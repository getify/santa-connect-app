Santa Connect is a mobile app you can use with your Santa-age kids to remind them that being nice is better than being naughty, especially as we draw near to the big day. It's designed for use on phones and tablets, in portrait mode.

You can track up to four kids, and for each, you track their naughty/nice balance, as well as up to five items on their wish list. Don't forget to show them that being more naughty marks off more of the items on their list!

## Purpose

This code base is a simple, quick-n-dirty experiment into [building a PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist).

There are other motivations, too. This code will serve as the basis for curriculum on refactoring highly imperative code into more functional code. Also, this will likely serve as a test-bed for explorations into web UI rendering architecture.
